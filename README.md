# bcanvas
Free online tool that helps you to visualise and share your business ideas. It provides you with three canvases:
* **Business Model Canvas** – originally introduced by Alexander Osterwalder and popularized by his [bestselling book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470876417) it changes the way of business model ideation. 
* **Lean Canvas** – is a version of the Business Model Canvas adopted for Lean Startup methodology by Ash Maurya. Check his [website](https://leanstack.com/) for dozens of helpful stuff.
* **Value Proposition Canvas** – was also introduced by Osterwalder in his [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118968050), but could be used only in his own [app](https://www.strategyzer.com/). Thanks to [Peter Thomson](https://www.peterjthomson.com/2013/11/value-proposition-canvas/) we propose his version of the canvas suits best for marketing strategy development.
